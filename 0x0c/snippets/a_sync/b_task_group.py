  - Tasks can easily and safely be cancelled. When a task is cancelled, 
    asyncio.CancelledError will be raised in the task at the next opportunity.
  - The first time any of the tasks belonging to the group fails with 
    an exception other than asyncio.CancelledError, the remaining tasks in 
    the group are canceled.
  - It is recommended that coroutines use try/finally blocks to robustly 
    perform clean-up logic. In case asyncio.CancelledError is explicitly 
    caught, it should generally be propagated when clean-up is complete.
