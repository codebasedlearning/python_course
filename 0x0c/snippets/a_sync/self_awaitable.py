Awaitables
From https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html
- We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await 
  expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.
- There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures

Futures
- A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual 
  result of an asynchronous operation. [...] 
- Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used 
  with async/await.
- Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.
