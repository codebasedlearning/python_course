What could be improved here?

Perhaps with a view to SOLID?

Single Responsibility: 
    Class does too many things: input, process, and output all mixed.
Open/Closed: 
    Hard to extend without modifying the existing class (e.g., change input format, new output destination).
Liskov Substitution: 
    No way to substitute for part of the behavior (e.g., alternative solvers, or new processing steps).
Interface Segregation: 
    No interfaces at all; client code (the main) is tied to the big bloated methods.
Dependency Inversion: 
    Depends directly on low-level details (how it reads, how it writes, how it computes), not abstractions.
