This snippet discusses time measurement.

Teaching focus
  - time

Key differences between `time.time()` and `time.process_time()`
- time()
    - Returns wall-clock time (real-world time)
    - Includes time spent in sleep and waiting for I/O
    - Returns seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970)
    - Higher resolution, includes fractions of seconds

- process_time()
    - Measures only CPU time used by the current process
    - Excludes sleep and I/O wait time
    - Returns relative value (not tied to epoch)
    - More accurate for pure CPU performance measurement
    - Includes both user and system CPU time (kernel code on behalf of the process)
