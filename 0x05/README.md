# Unit `0x05` â€“ GroPro-Setup

> The aim is to model and solve GroPro (Grosse Programmieraufgabe IHK) problems in unit 0x05.
> - Unit 0x01: First Impression (examples)
> - Unit 0x02: First Steps (variables, control-flow, functions)
> - Unit 0x03: Finalize Basics (classes, inheritance, types)
> - Unit 0x04: Puzzle-Driven Programming Challenges 
> - Unit 0x05: Softwaredesign principles, SOLID, GroPro with IPO

> Note: the principles are not specific to Python, they must always be followed. But it's also about what you can prepare now, so that you have a framework for the exam (IPO) and don't have to think about everything from scratch.


## SOLID

> SOLID is a mnemonic for five fundamental principles of object-oriented software design, intended to make code:
> - Flexible
> - Reusable
> - Maintainable
> - Scalable

It originated mainly with Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and friends in the early 2000s.

> SOLID is not about writing more code. Itâ€™s about writing code that survives changes, extensions, and teamwork.


### Definition

| Principle                | Short Definition                                                                  |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| S: Single Responsibility | A class should have only one reason to change.                                    |
| O: Open/Closed           | Software should be open for extension, but closed for modification.               |
| L: Liskov Substitution   | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without breaking the program. |
| I: Interface Segregation | Prefer many small, specific interfaces over one big fat interface.                |
| D: Dependency Inversion  | Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.                             |


### Related to Python

#### S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class (or function) should do one thing and do it well. In Python, this usually means:
- Keep classes focused.
- Split long functions into small helpers.
- Modules should also have a focused purpose.

('Doing just one thing' is not exactly the same as 'having one reason to change'â€”the former is about behavior, and the latter is about responsibility, but the former is 95% correct and practical.)


#### O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

You should be able to extend a classâ€™s behavior without modifying its source. In Python, this often means:
- Use inheritance, composition, or higher-order functions.
- Prefer adding new classes/functions over editing old ones.


#### L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Subclasses should behave like the parent class, without surprises. In Python:
- When you extend a base class or protocol, you must not break expectations.
- Inputs and outputs must still "make sense."

```
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        print("Flying!")

class Duck(Bird):
    pass

class Ostrich(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Ostriches can't fly!")  # BAD!
```

So `Duck` is fine, `Ostrich` violates LSP. Better design would be a `FlyingBird` and `FlightlessBird` split, not a bad inheritance.


#### I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Users shouldnâ€™t be forced to depend on interfaces they donâ€™t use. In Python:
- Keep base classes small.
- Split large protocols (interfaces) into focused ones.


#### D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Depend on abstractions, not concrete details." In Python:
- Inject dependencies via constructors or functions.
- Program to protocols / abstract classes, not implementations.

```
class Database(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def save(self, data): ...

class MySQLDatabase(Database):
    def save(self, data):
        print(f"Saving {data} to MySQL")

class Service:
    def __init__(self, db: Database):
        self.db = db

    def process(self, data):
        self.db.save(data)
```

This way it is easy to switch the database later. Hardcoding `MySQLDatabase` inside `Service` would be a bad design.


### SOLID Design Checklist (Python Edition)

#### Single Responsibility
- Does this class only do one thing?
- Would I need to change this class for more than one reason?
- If yes â†’ split it.

#### Open/Closed
- Can I extend behavior without modifying existing classes?
- Am I adding new classes/functions instead of hacking old ones?
- If not â†’ refactor with inheritance or composition.

#### Liskov Substitution
- If I replace a parent class object with a child object, does the program still behave correctly?
- If I replace a child object with a parent object (using only parent features), does the program still behave correctly?
- Do all overridden methods behave consistently with expectations?
- If not â†’ split classes or rethink inheritance.

#### Interface Segregation
- Is this interface or base class small and focused?
- Are users forced to implement methods they donâ€™t need?
- If yes â†’ split interfaces into smaller ones.

#### Dependency Inversion
- Is this class depending on abstractions (interfaces/protocols) rather than concrete classes?
- Can I swap implementations easily (e.g., MySQL âž” Postgres âž” Mock)?
- If not â†’ introduce abstract base classes or protocols.

## Tasks

---

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'IPO'

- Review all snippets from the lecture. Ask if there are any outstanding questions.

---

### ðŸ‘‰ Task 'GroPro'

- Choose one (or more) of the GroPros:
  - Crosswords
  - Service Stations
  - Wooden Puzzle

Try to solve the problem(s), but also try to take the SOLID principles into account.
