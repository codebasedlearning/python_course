# Unit `0x05` – GroPro-Setup

> The aim is to model and solve GroPro (Grosse Programmieraufgabe IHK) problems in unit 0x05.
> - Unit 0x01: First Impression (examples)
> - Unit 0x02: First Steps (variables, control-flow, functions)
> - Unit 0x03: Finalize Basics (classes, inheritance, types)
> - Unit 0x04: Puzzle-Driven Programming Challenges 
> - Unit 0x05: Softwaredesign principles, SOLID, GroPro with IPO

> Note: the principles are not specific to Python, they must always be followed. But it's also about what you can prepare now, so that you have a framework for the exam (IPO) and don't have to think about everything from scratch.


## SOLID

> SOLID is a mnemonic for five fundamental principles of object-oriented software design, intended to make code:
> - Flexible
> - Reusable
> - Maintainable
> - Scalable

It originated mainly with Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and friends in the early 2000s.

> SOLID is not about writing more code. It’s about writing code that survives changes, extensions, and teamwork.


### Definition

| Principle                | Short Definition                                                                  |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| S: Single Responsibility | A class should have only one reason to change.                                    |
| O: Open/Closed           | Software should be open for extension, but closed for modification.               |
| L: Liskov Substitution   | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without breaking the program. |
| I: Interface Segregation | Prefer many small, specific interfaces over one big fat interface.                |
| D: Dependency Inversion  | Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.                             |


### Related to Python

#### S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class (or function) should do one thing and do it well. In Python, this usually means:
- Keep classes focused.
- Split long functions into small helpers.
- Modules should also have a focused purpose.

('Doing just one thing' is not exactly the same as 'having one reason to change'—the former is about behavior, and the latter is about responsibility, but the former is 95% correct and practical.)


#### O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

You should be able to extend a class’s behavior without modifying its source. In Python, this often means:
- Use inheritance, composition, or higher-order functions.
- Prefer adding new classes/functions over editing old ones.


#### L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Subclasses should behave like the parent class, without surprises. In Python:
- When you extend a base class or protocol, you must not break expectations.
- Inputs and outputs must still "make sense."

```
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        print("Flying!")

class Duck(Bird):
    pass

class Ostrich(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Ostriches can't fly!")  # BAD!
```

So `Duck` is fine, `Ostrich` violates LSP. Better design would be a `FlyingBird` and `FlightlessBird` split, not a bad inheritance.


#### I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Users shouldn’t be forced to depend on interfaces they don’t use. In Python:
- Keep base classes small.
- Split large protocols (interfaces) into focused ones.


#### D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Depend on abstractions, not concrete details." In Python:
- Inject dependencies via constructors or functions.
- Program to protocols / abstract classes, not implementations.

```
class Database(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def save(self, data): ...

class MySQLDatabase(Database):
    def save(self, data):
        print(f"Saving {data} to MySQL")

class Service:
    def __init__(self, db: Database):
        self.db = db

    def process(self, data):
        self.db.save(data)
```

This way it is easy to switch the database later. Hardcoding `MySQLDatabase` inside `Service` would be a bad design.


### SOLID Design Checklist (Python Edition)

#### Single Responsibility
- Does this class only do one thing?
- Would I need to change this class for more than one reason?
- If yes → split it.

#### Open/Closed
- Can I extend behavior without modifying existing classes?
- Am I adding new classes/functions instead of hacking old ones?
- If not → refactor with inheritance or composition.

#### Liskov Substitution
- If I replace a parent class object with a child object, does the program still behave correctly?
- If I replace a child object with a parent object (using only parent features), does the program still behave correctly?
- Do all overridden methods behave consistently with expectations?
- If not → split classes or rethink inheritance.

#### Interface Segregation
- Is this interface or base class small and focused?
- Are users forced to implement methods they don’t need?
- If yes → split interfaces into smaller ones.

#### Dependency Inversion
- Is this class depending on abstractions (interfaces/protocols) rather than concrete classes?
- Can I swap implementations easily (e.g., MySQL ➔ Postgres ➔ Mock)?
- If not → introduce abstract base classes or protocols.

## Tasks

---

### 👉 Task 'IPO'

- Review all snippets from the lecture. Ask if there are any outstanding questions.

---

### 👉 Task 'GroPro'

- Choose one (or more) of the GroPros:
  - Crosswords
  - Service Stations
  - Wooden Puzzle

Try to solve the problem(s), but also try to take the SOLID principles into account.

---

### 👉 Task 'Couch Potato' - Recurring homework

- If you did not finish the essential tasks in the exercise, finish them at home.

---

### 👉 Comprehension Check - Talk with your Neighbor

General
- How would you build a solution for a GroPro?
- What can you prepare in advance?

---

### 👉 Lecture Check - Online Questionare
