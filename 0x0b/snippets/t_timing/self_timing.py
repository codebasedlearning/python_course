"""
From Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elapsed_real_time
  - Elapsed real time, real time, wall-clock time, wall time, or walltime is 
    the actual time taken from the start of a computer program to the end. 
    In other words, it is the difference between the time at which a task 
    finishes and the time at which the task started.
  - Wall time is thus different from CPU time, which measures only the time 
    during which the processor is actively working on a certain task  
  - The difference between the two can arise from architecture and run-time 
    dependent factors, e.g. programmed delays or waiting for system resources 
    to become available. 

Note: Often time functions call platform-specific library functions, i.e. 
these functions are platform-dependent under the hood.

Also note:
  - `time.process_time()` measures the total aggregated CPU time for 
    all threads in the program.
    This can make the value seem inflated if compared to wall-clock time 
    for multi-threaded tasks.

  - To measure CPU time on a per-thread basis, consider external libraries 
    like `psutil`.
