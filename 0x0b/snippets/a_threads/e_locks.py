deadlocks
  - The basic problem here is that threads have already acquired some 
    resources and are waiting for others, which in turn are being blocked 
    by other threads.
  - See
    https://superfastpython.com/threading-in-python/
    
livelocks
  - In this situation, no thread is blocking, but by continually blocking 
    one resource and asking for the second, no thread is making any progress.
