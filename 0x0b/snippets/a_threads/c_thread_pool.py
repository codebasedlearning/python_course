"""
ThreadPoolExecutor
From https://realpython.com/intro-to-python-threading/
  - Using a ThreadPoolExecutor can cause some confusing errors. For example, 
    if you call a function that takes no parameters, but you pass it parameters 
    in .map(), the thread will throw an exception. Unfortunately, ThreadPoolExecutor 
    will hide that exception, and (in the case above) the program terminates 
    with no output. This can be quite confusing to debug at first.
