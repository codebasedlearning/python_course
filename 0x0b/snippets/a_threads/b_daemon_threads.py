This snippet is about deamon threads and atexit.

Teaching focus
  - start threads as daemons
  - register atexit functions

Also note 'README.md' for terms and references, and

"""
daemons and threads
From https://realpython.com/intro-to-python-threading/#daemon-threads
  - If a program is running Threads that are not daemons, then the program 
    will wait for those threads to complete before it terminates. 
  - Threads that are daemons, however, are just killed wherever they are 
    when the program is exiting.

atexit
From https://docs.python.org/3/library/atexit.html
  - The 'atexit' module defines functions to register and unregister cleanup 
    functions. 
  - Functions thus registered are automatically executed upon normal 
    interpreter termination.
  - 'atexit' runs these functions in the reverse order in which they were 
    registered [...].
