"""
new threads, not started
  - Until start a thread is only an object. Usually it is not cheap to create 
    and/or start a thread, so this is the reason for using thread pools, 
    which we will see later.

sleep
  - In the examples, 'sleep' always represents a task that takes some time 
    to complete. This could be a calculation or a complex IO operation such 
    as querying a database.

join
  - Now that the thread has been started, the question is how long will it 
    run and do I have a need for the data that has been created there.
    This is where you need to think about the properties of the thread in 
    terms of its life cycle. The 'join' command is waiting for the thread 
    to finish its work. This is called a 'blocking call'.
