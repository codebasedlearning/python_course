This snippet is about race conditions, the GIL, deadlocks and livelocks.

Teaching focus
  - race conditions
  - deadlocks and livelocks
  - GIL

Note: The problems discussed here are not specific to Python, and the
solution can only be a matter of thought :-)

Also note 'README.md' for terms and references, and
'thread_helper.py' for relative time durations.

GIL
see https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-global-interpreter-lock
  - This is not only Python-specific, but even dependent on the concrete 
    Python implementation, namely Cpython.
  - The mechanism used by the CPython interpreter to assure that only one 
    thread executes Python bytecode at a time. This simplifies the CPython 
    implementation by making the object model (including critical built-in 
    types such as dict) implicitly safe against concurrent access. Locking 
    the entire interpreter makes it easier for the interpreter to be 
    multi-threaded, at the expense of much of the parallelism afforded by
    multi-processor machines.
  - You can even customise these time frames when threads change, but it 
    is better to avoid this and use the defaults. See here
        sys.setswitchinterval(0.0005)

clean up or call something
  - The crucial point here is the small, inconsequential change in the code 
    that suddenly causes a bug to appear in a function that is supposed to 
    be working...
