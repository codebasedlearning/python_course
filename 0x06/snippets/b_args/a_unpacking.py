Summary

Topics
  - unpacking
  - starred expressions (* and **)

Starred expressions
  - They allow you to unpack or capture multiple elements from a sequence 
    (like a list, tuple, or other iterable) in a concise and flexible way. 
    The `*` operator can be used in various contexts, such as assignments, 
    function arguments, or list comprehensions.
