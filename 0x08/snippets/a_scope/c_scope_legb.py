closures

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)
  - In programming languages, a closure, also lexical closure or function 
    closure, is a technique for implementing lexically scoped name binding 
    in a language with first-class functions. Operationally, a closure is 
    a record storing a function[a] together with an environment. 
  - The environment is a mapping associating each free variable of the function 
    (variables that are used locally, but defined in an enclosing scope) with 
    the value or reference to which the name was bound when the closure was 
    created. Unlike a plain function, a closure allows the function to access 
    those captured variables through the closure's copies of their values or 
    references, even when the function is invoked outside their scope.
